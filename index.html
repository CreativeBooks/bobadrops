        <p>The Hubble Space Telescope is a large space observatory that orbits Earth, launched in 1990 by a NASA space
            shuttle. It provides high-resolution images and data by observing light in the ultraviolet, visible, and
            near-infrared wavelengths, and has revolutionized astronomy by allowing scientists to see farther and
            clearer than with ground-based telescopes.</p>
